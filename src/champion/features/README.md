# Features

Domain scope: feature engineering and indicator computation.

Current contents:
- Indicators, demo features, integration examples.

Migration notes:
- Move any scattered feature code here; keep compute functions pure and Polars-first.
- Relocate tests to `tests/` and add fixtures for sample time series.
